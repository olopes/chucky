# chucky
Chucky is a radio transmitter that uses a Wii Nunchuk remote and flysky protocol using a microcontroller atmega328p (and maybe an attiny85).

The nunchuk code was adapted from these sources:

The flysky transmitter code is adapted from the code shared at rcgroups (thanks to midelic, PhracturedBlue, dave1993 and other):

**Notes:**
<br/>
I need to update the license. Probably there are some licensing restrictions to use the code from the above sources and I will update my own code accordingly.

This is a very early stage of development. These are mostly sample sketches that are only useful to test the microcontroller wirings.
